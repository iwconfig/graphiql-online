# this is a fork

I modified `graphiql-online.js` in `gh-pages` branch to work with url search params.

I don't know *anything* about React so maybe I missed something or if it's supposed to generate the `graphiql-online.js` file or whatever so I'm leaving the changes in my own fork for now instead of issuing a PR to upstream.

## update

- Also added `query` and `variables` parameters,
- and now `endpoint` is saved to localStorage as well.
